Pointers
--------

#. Pointer size depends on system's address bus size. For a 64 bit
   machine, pointer occupies 8 bytes.

#. Pointers are regular variables, they just meant to store address. 
   Its also possible to retrieve data from the stored address. 

#. An integer pointer is capable of holding address of integer, although
   as mentioned, all pointers can hold 8 byte address, but it is required
   to specify datatype to fetch correct length of data from the stored address.
